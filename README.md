# n00b's Codewars Solution vs. Pro's Solution
Hint: I'm the noob

## This is for my  [YouTube video about Codewars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTIcR4GxQrI), check it out!
You can see the original Codewars kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bb6539a4cf1b12d90005b7):
<br>
> Given a game board from the game Battleship, return whether the game, and the pieces palced on it, are valid.

### [noob.js](/noob.js):
is my original code from when I first solved this kata. It's overcomplicated, heavy haded, one might look at it and say "you went full OOP, never go full OOP."
### [pro.js](/pro.js):
is my friend [OdatNurd's](https://github.com/OdatNurd) solution. Simple, elegant, badass, l33t, definitiely written by a god-mode coder.

### Purpose:
This is a demonstration of how learning how to solve small coding problems is **AS IMPORTANT** as knowing how to code large projects. One should practice a balance of both. If you can solve small, self-contained problems, and then use those problems as building blocks to solve larger coding projects, then you have truly become 1337.
