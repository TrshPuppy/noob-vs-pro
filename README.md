# n00b's Codewars Solution vs. Pro's Solution
Hint: I'm the noob

## This is for my  [YouTube video about Codewars](), check it out!
You can see the original Codewars kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bb6539a4cf1b12d90005b7):
<br>
**TL;DR** Given a game board from the game Battleship, return whether the game, and the pieces palced on it, are valid.

### noob.js
is my, original code from when I first solved this kata
### pro.js
is my friend [OdatNurd's](https://github.com/OdatNurd) solution; badass, l33t, knows what he's doing, etc.

### Purpose:
This is a demonstration of how learning how to solve small coding problems is **AS IMPORTANT** as knowing how to code large projects.
